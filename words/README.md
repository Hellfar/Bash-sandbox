Words
=====

Words is a little Bash script that finds randomly a word in the file list given in parameter.
Imaginated to play in improving English (or others) vocabulary skills.

I've made the list of english words by mixing some lists I've found on the web.

```
./randomWord.sh [ FILELIST ]
```

If the FILELIST param is missing "wordlist_en.txt" will be considered as the name file list of words to look in for.
